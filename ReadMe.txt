#oto the auto clicker

This auto clicker is the fastest auto clicker I have ever found/created.
To compare "OP Auto Clicker 3.0" has a maximum CPS of about 64, where "oto" has a stable* CPS of 200 and an unstable* CPS 1000+

* Stable meaning most apps can still comprehend it, but you might experience some lag.
Unstable I have yet to encounter something that doesn't lag or out right crashes.

---------- FROM oto -----------
* This is an estimate made on an old pc. I have no real way of measureing it, because it is simply to fast. 
But I can say it is over 1000 CPS since that is the max my CPS-measure can measure accurate.


** CPS can vary with quite a big margin depending on the performance of the CPU.
I have measured (on -1) all fom 77-250 CPS. But -2 is still faster than -1.
