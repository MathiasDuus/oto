* This is an estimate made on an old pc. I have no real way of measureing it, because it is simply to fast. 
But I can say it is over 1000 CPS since that is the max my CPS-measure can measure accurate.


** CPS can vary with quite a big margin depending on the performance of the CPU.
I have measured (on -1) all fom 77-250 CPS. But -2 is still faster than -1.
