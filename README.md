# oto the auto clicker

This auto clicker is the fastest auto clicker I have ever found/created.

To compare "OP Auto Clicker 3.0" has a maximum CPS of about 64, where "oto"
can run a CPS of 200 and an CPS 1000+ with no limiter.


HELP
---------------------
Delay: it is the time between each click.
Higer delay lower CPS.

0: No delay, it goes as fast as possible.
-1: Should be around 100 CPS, may vary.
-2:Should be around 200 CPS, may vary.


*NOTE
CPS can vary with quite a big margin depending on the performance of the CPU.
I have measured (on -1) all fom 77-250 CPS. But -2 is still faster than -1.
