# oto the auto clicker

This auto clicker is the fastest auto clicker I have ever found/created.

To compare "OP Auto Clicker 3.0" has a maximum CPS of about 64, where "oto"
can run a CPS of 200 and an CPS 1000+ with no limiter.


HELP
---------------------
#### Delay: <br>
It is the time between each click. <br>
Higer delay lower CPS.<br>

0: No delay, it goes as fast as possible. <br>
-1: Should be around 100 CPS, may vary. <br>
-2:Should be around 200 CPS, may vary. <br>

#### Max clicks: <br>
If you anly want to click an X amount of times.


##### *NOTE <br>
CPS can vary with quite a big margin depending on the performance of the CPU.<br>
I have measured (on -1) all fom 77-250 CPS. But -2 is still faster than -1.<br>
